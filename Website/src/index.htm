    <h1>What can I ask the Assistant?</h1>
    <h2>The assistant can respond to a multitude of commands such as:</h2>
    <h3><ul>
      <li>'What's the weather like?</li>
      <li>'What time is it?'</li>
      <li>'Can you translate this sentence for me?'</li>
      <li>'Tell me a joke!'</li>
      <li>'When did the First World War end?'</li>
      ...and many more!
     
    </ul></h3>
    <h1>Am I always being recorded?</h1>
    <h3>Short answer: Yes. The Google Assistant API activates after using a hotword, but device has to listen all the time to react when hetword was used.</h3>
